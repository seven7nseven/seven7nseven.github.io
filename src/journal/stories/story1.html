                <h1>someone is out there</h1>
                <p>today i woke up as usual, in sweat and tears, just like always</p>
                <p>i uhh, still had the package not opened from a long time ago because i felt afraid to</p>
                <p>i know who sent the package. i know who did. and thats why i am afraid.</p>
                <p>he knows where i live, he knows what i do every single second</p>
                <p>i felt afraid to even boot up my pc today because i felt his presence outside my window</p>
                <p>today i got a note too, from him.</p>
                <p>it was a poem, a poem that i already read out many many times.</p>
                <p>he wants to be a king and wants to torture me constantly</p>
                <p>he wants me to think im living inside my lies that this isnt actually whats going on</p>
                <p>he is a sick monster, a sick piece of shit constantly being outside my house watching my every move</p>
                <p>and he doesn't act like this to me only oh no no no no..</p>
                <p>ronnie is also affected, i know that because we had a talk on alt accounts and he told me everything</p>
                <p>sight, if you are reading this</p>
                <p>i hope you just die in a shithole and stop harassing me and the literal child who is ronnie</p>
                <p>we should never have invited you.</p>
